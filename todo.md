# Scheduled todos

- test cache for createsafe is created once and is an old obj when it is needed
- add awaitCallback feature (add tests, code, data to the readme)
- explain queue and loop on safe interval with async callable and callback
- decide on what to allow on a public repository (if any is configurable), like pull requests etc.
- finalize and publish the npm package (check license among other things)
